This is the short history of Aroria:

The history of Aroria is a tale of magic, conflict, and mystery. Born from the union of elemental forces, Aroria was first shaped by the Eldrians, an ancient race harmonizing magic and nature. They created the Elemental Relics, powerful artifacts embodying the land's elemental essence.

However, peace was shattered by the Cataclysm, leading to the Eldrians' disappearance and the fracturing of Aroria. In the aftermath, new races like Humans, Elves, and Dwarves emerged, building their own civilizations amidst the ruins of the past.

Centuries of strife followed, marked by a relentless pursuit of magic and power. The rediscovery of an Elemental Relic reignited the quest for these ancient artifacts, believed to hold immense power and secrets.

In the current age, Aroria finds itself at a pivotal moment, where the search for the Elemental Relics could unravel the mysteries of the past and shape the future of the land. The echoes of the Eldrians' legacy await, hidden in the shadows of this magical world.`;
